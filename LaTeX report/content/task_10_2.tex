\section{Optimal Control of Pitch/Travel without Feedback}\label{kap:Part2OptimalControlWithoutFeedback}

\subsection{Derivation of a continous time state space model}
In this part of the exercise we will disregard elevation, therefore we assume $ e = 0 $ and do include it in the model.

The state-vector, $\bm x$ is defined as:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:lab2_state}
	\bm x = 
	\begin{bmatrix}
		\lambda & r & p & \dot p
	\end{bmatrix}
	^T ,
\end{equation}
where $\lambda$ is travel, $r$ is the travel rate, $p$ is pitch and $\dot{p}$ is pitch rate.

The dynamic equations for the system was given in the problem description \todo{Add ref to page and paper}. These following equations were given:
\begin{subequations} \label{eq:lab2_states_eq}
	\begin{align}
		\dot \lambda &= r \\
		\dot r &= -K_2 p, \quad K_2 = \frac{K_p l_a}{J_t}\\
		\dot p &= \dot p \\
		\ddot p &= -K_1 V_d = K_1 K_{pd} \dot p - K_1 K_{pp} p + K_1 K_{pp} pc, \quad K_1 = \frac{K_f l_h}{J_p}
	\end{align}
\end{subequations}
The state-space form of the system therefore becomes: 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:lab2_cont_ss}
	\underbrace{\begin{bmatrix}
		\dot \lambda \\
		\dot r \\
		\dot p \\
		\ddot p
	\end{bmatrix}}_{\bm{\dot x}} = 
	\underbrace{
	\begin{bmatrix}
		0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
		0 & 0 & -K_2 & 0 \\
		0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\
		0 & 0 & -K_1 K_{pp} &  -K_1 K_{pd}
	\end{bmatrix}
	}_{\bm A_c}
	\begin{bmatrix}
		\lambda \\ r \\ p \\ \dot{p} \\
	\end{bmatrix}
	+
	\underbrace{
		\begin{bmatrix}
			0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ K_1 K_{pp}
		\end{bmatrix}
	}_{\bm B_c} \underbrace{p_c}_{u}
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{A deeper dive into the state-space model}
The state-space form of the system models two part of the whole system, namely: 
\begin{enumerate}
	\item The physics of the helicopter.
	\item The proportional-derivative controller for the pitch.
\end{enumerate}
This is shown in \cref{fig:lab2_system} where the red dotted box shows what we model with the state space model. \todo[inline]{Add ref to the figure in the problem description}

\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{figures/lab2_system}
	\caption{The red box encapsulate what is modelled in the state space model described by \cref{eq:lab2_cont_ss}.}
	\label{fig:lab2_system}
\end{figure}

This becomes clear studying the equations in \cref{eq:lab2_states_eq}. They describe the helicopters physics for all states except elevation and elevation rate. $ \lambda $ and $ r $ is dependent on the helicopters pitch, $ p $. $ p $ and $ \dot p  $ is however dependent on the voltage difference, $ V_d $. The voltage difference is the output of the PD-controller for controlling the pitch\todo{Should we add acronym list?}. 

To summarize, this means that our state space model describes the helicopter's physics through the dynamic equations for $ \lambda $, $ r $, $ p $ and $ \dot p $, while the equation of $ V_d $ describes the PD-controller used to control the pitch angle. In total our state-space model is modelling both the helicopter and the PD controller for pitch.


\subsubsection{Stability and eigenvalues}
The properties of this system is dependent on physical constants ($l_a, J_t, ...$) and control parameters ($K_{pp}, K_{pd}$).

Symbolic expressions in Matlab shows that the eigenvalues of A are:
\begin{equation}
	\lambda = \pm \frac{1}{2} \left( \sqrt{-K_1 (-K_1 K_{pd}^2 + 4  K_{pp})} - K_1  K_{pd} \right)
\end{equation}

The eigenvalues of the continous model, with $K_{pp} = 0,1 , K_{pd} = 0,4$ are:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:lab2_ss_c_eigenvalues_example}
	\begin{bmatrix}
		0 \\ 0 \\ -0.26 + 0.24i \\ -0.26 - 0.24 \\
	\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}

% ------------------- DISCRETIZING THE MODEL ------------------------
\subsection{Discretizing the continous time model}
A discretized model is required for generating an optimal trajectory. \textit{[...] continous time models require quite different solution methods} \cite{FossHeirung}

We will discretize the model using the forward Euler method, which is given by:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:lab2_forward_euler}
	\bm{x}[k + 1] = \bm I \bm x[k] + T\bm{A_c x}[k] + T\bm B_c ,
\end{equation}
where $ T $ is the timestep \todo[inline]{timestep in the discretization??}\todo
[inline]{Add reference to linsys slides}.
Reformulating this, we can write:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:lab2_discrete_system}
	\bm{x}_{k + 1} = \underbrace{(\bm I + T \bm A_c)}_{\bm A_d} \bm{x}_{k} + \underbrace{T \bm B_c}_{\bm B_d} u_k
\end{equation}



\subsubsection{Checking stability}
The stability condition for \cref{eq:lab2_discrete_system} is:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:lab2_stab_condition}
	|1 + T \lambda| \leq 1
\end{equation}, where $ \lambda $ is an eigenvalue of $ \bm A_c $ in \cref{eq:lab2_discrete_system}. 
\todo[inline]{Where is this equation from? I believe that it works, but we should either derive it or reference where we found it. ANSWER: From linsys slides, see above}
Using MATLAB we found the eigenvalues of $ \bm A $ to be ... \todo[inline]{Add Matlab appendix}

\subsection{The open loop optimization problem}
\textit{How is it formulated?}

The optimization problem is to calculate an optimal trajectory for moving the helicopter from $\lambda_0 = \pi$ to $\lambda_f = 0$ by manipulating the input, $p_k$, of the pitch controller.

We also have a constraint on the input to the pitch controller:
\begin{equation}
	\left\lvert p_k \right\rvert \le \frac{30}{180} \pi, k \in \left\{ 1, ..., N \right\} 
\end{equation}
this constraint says that the pitch-reference, $p_k$ can not exceed 30 degrees in either direction.

Our objective function (the cost function we wish to minimize) is given as:
\begin{equation}
	\phi = \sum_{i=0}^{N-1} \left( \lambda_{i+1} - \lambda_f \right)^2 + qp_{ci}^2 , q \ge 0
\end{equation}
where $q$ is the weight of input-usage.

\todo[inline] {Add the steps in our formulation. How we get to the quadprog-formulation:} 
\begin{itemize}
	\item How the model is formulated
	\item How we formulate it as a QP problem with z
	\item What out constraints are (equality $ A_{eq} z = B_{eq} $, inequality: $ u_{low} < ... $)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{The weights of the optimization problem}
\textit{Try using the values 0.1, 1 and 10 as weights q. Plot the manipulated variable and the output. Comment the results with respect to the different weights chosen.}

Weighing the input higher by increasing the value of $q$ means that we are placing a higher cost of input - reducing the input usage. This will in turn mean that the cost of deviation in $\lambda$ is in relation to the input, cheaper. The result is lower input usage and a slower response. This is exactly what is seen in \cref{fig:lab2optimalu}.

	\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{figures/lab2_optimal_u}
	\caption{Manipulated variable and outputs with different values of $q$.}

\end{figure}

\subsection{The objective function}
\textit{Furthermore, discuss the objective function (15) (in the lab assignment text) in particular the term $(\lambda_i-\lambda_f )^2$. For instance, could any unwanted effects arise from steering the helicopter to $\lambda =\lambda_f$ with this objective function?}
